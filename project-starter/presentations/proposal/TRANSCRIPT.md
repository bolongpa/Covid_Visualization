* Important features and designs
    * Connect the data with map. When clicking the map, the information of that state would show up.
    * Line bar charts that compare number of Covid cases with unemployment rate.
    * Compute the difference of unemployment with given timestamps and show which states suffer the most. 
* Challenges
    * As we do not have the experience with map plot, it might be the biggest challenge when building the project.
## Slide 8
* Data sources
    * Covid Data:  [CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data)
    * Unemployment rate by state: [US Local Area Unemployment Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/lau/)
    * COVID-19 policy actions by state: [US Government Response to Coronavirus](https://www.usa.gov/coronavirus)
* Tools:
    * JavaScript/Jquery/D3
    * Inkscape
    * Python
## Slide 9
* Data Preprocessing:
    * Covid Data is separated by date, to make is easier to retrieve data, we will group them into a file or at least by month.
    * The unemployment rate files are separated by states, so we need to combine them together into a file.
    *   Extract important policies regarding Covid, such as lockdown policy.
