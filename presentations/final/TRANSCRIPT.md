Slide 1, Introduction

Our project aims to provide an overview on how the COVID-19 affected the U.S. labor market, and whether or not it is recovering from the impact of COVID-19. The data visualization technology can help researchers to identify how covid-19 pandemic impacted the unemployment rate with more ease. Otherwise, it can be difficult to recognize some latent information like what potentially impacted the unemployment rate in a state.
