Problem statement:
- The data visualization technology helps researchers to identify how covid-19 pandemic impacted the unemployment rate with more ease. Otherwise, it can be difficult to recognize some latent information like what potentially impacted the unemployment rate in a state.
      
Novelty:
(Updated description in slide #1 "Introduction" in Transcript.md.)
The unique part of our project is that we not only focus on how the unemployment rate changes over the pandemic months, but also how the U.S. labor market is recovering from the COVID-19 impact. In order to achieve our purpose, we will visualize:
1. The confirmed cases of COVID-19
2. The unemployment rate
3. The number of job openings (data Source: https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.t01.htm)

We wish to provide users the insight into the current U.S. labor market through our visualization, and eventually the idea of how the U.S. labor market would go in the near future.
