To see our current work, type below commands in your targeted local folder:

* First, clone the project-ninjav folder:

  ```git clone https://github.com/DSCI-554/project-ninjav.git```

> Currently there might be some warnings showing up while starting/building the app.
> They are only warnings, not errors, and we will clear it in the near future,
> so don't panic :)
