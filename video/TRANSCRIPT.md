## Project Introduction Tab
Hi, we are NinjaV, this is our data visualization project, Labor Market After Coronavirus. The goal of this project is to visualize the relationship between COVID-19 confirmed cases and the unemployment situation in the US. We divide our project into 3 sessions, which are: the US Labor Market Overview page, the Data Exploration page and the Unemployment Claims page.
## US Labor Market Overview Tab
In this page, we built an infographic to give users an overview of the labor market. [scroll] In the first part, we compare the US unemployment rate with other countries. [scroll] Secondly, we list out some important events in US history that strikes the US labor market severely, [scroll] In the third part of this page, we provide some information on the current labor market situation (as of Oct. 2020).
For a better understanding of the relationship between unemployment rate and number of covid cases, letâ€™s go to the Data Exploration page.
## Data Exploration Tab
The tips written at the beginning of this page give users a hint to explore our interactive charts. Users can hide the tips by clicking on the button.
We included three plots in this page, both the map and the lollipop chart visualize the unemployment rate change as well as the number of increased COVID confirmed cases in a specific period between January 2020 to August 2020. The length of the lollipop indicates the number of increased confirmed cases, while the color of the candy indicates the unemployment rate change, the color scale is the same as the one used in the map. The line chart at the bottom visualizes the newly confirmed cases and the unemployment rate of each month all the way from January 2019 to August 2020.
Users can pick a period here and observe the change of unemployment rate during that time. After a specific period is chosen by the user, both the map and the lollipop chart would be updated accordingly.
Users can also click on the play button to see the transition animation. The unemployment rate recovery situation of each state can be observed through this animation.
Moreover, by hovering over the map or hovering over the lollipops, the increased number of the confirmed cases of that state during the chosen period will show up.
The line chart at the bottom initially shows the total newly confirmed cases and unemployment rate of each month in the US. Users can either click on the lollipop or click on the area of a state to see the line chart of that particular state.
## Unemployment Claims Tab
Lastly, we also include two visualizations regarding the number of the unemployment claims in the US. We include a mapbox visualizing the unemployment claims of each state in October 2020, [scroll] and 3 donut charts to compare the types of unemployment claims before and after COVID outbreak.
